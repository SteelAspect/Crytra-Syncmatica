/**
 * Tells build management which chunk columns changed, so a completion scan can
 * look at those instead of at everything.
 *
 * <p>This is the one place every server-side block change passes through with
 * both states in hand, and its shape has held from 1.17 to now — only the name
 * moved with the mappings. The alternative hooks are worse: {@code World} lost
 * {@code onBlockChanged} to a rename, and {@code WorldChunk.setBlockState}
 * changed its third parameter's type.
 *
 * <p>This runs on every redstone tick and every flowing water update on the
 * server, so it does as little as it possibly can: the tracker's first act is a
 * volatile read that costs nothing when no schematic is being tracked.
